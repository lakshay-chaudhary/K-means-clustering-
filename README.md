## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a key strategy for understanding customer behavior, optimizing marketing efforts, and improving customer satisfaction. In this project, we use the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchasing habits and characteristics, helping businesses create targeted strategies.

## Project Overview

This project applies **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers into distinct groups. The goal is to identify patterns in the data and provide actionable insights for businesses.

Key objectives include:
- Identifying distinct customer groups.
- Visualizing customer segments.
- Providing recommendations for marketing strategies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as:
- **Customer ID**
- **Age**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**
- **Gender** (if applicable)

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data to remove any missing or inconsistent entries.
2. **Feature Selection**: Selecting key features like age, income, and spending score for clustering.
3. **K-Means Algorithm**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into different clusters.
4. **Evaluation**: Using the **elbow method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizing clusters using **2D** and **3D scatter plots**.

## Results and Insights

The K-Means algorithm identified **X clusters**, representing distinct customer segments. These segments provide valuable insights into customer behavior, such as:
- High-spending younger customers
- Budget-conscious customers
- Middle-aged high-income customers
