Introduction
Customer segmentation is a key strategy for understanding customer behavior, optimizing marketing efforts, and improving customer satisfaction. In this project, we use the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchasing habits and characteristics, helping businesses create targeted strategies.

Project Overview
This project applies K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers into distinct groups. The goal is to identify patterns in the data and provide actionable insights for businesses.

Key objectives include:

Identifying distinct customer groups.
Visualizing customer segments.
Providing recommendations for marketing strategies.
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as:

Customer ID
Age
Annual Income
Spending Score
Gender (if applicable)
You can download the dataset here (replace with actual link).

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data to remove any missing or inconsistent entries.
Feature Selection: Selecting key features like age, income, and spending score for clustering.
K-Means Algorithm: Applying the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into different clusters.
Evaluation: Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualization: Visualizing clusters using 2D and 3D scatter plots.
Results and Insights
The K-Means algorithm identified X clusters, representing distinct customer segments. These segments provide valuable insights into customer behavior, such as:

High-spending younger customers
Budget-conscious customers
Middle-aged high-income customers
(Add specific details and visualizations as per your project.)

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Installation
To set up the project locally, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the following command to start the segmentation process:

bash
Copy code
python kmeans_clustering.py
For customizations, you can modify the number of clusters in the config.yaml file.

Future Work
Applying different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
Enhancing the dataset with more features (e.g., purchase history, customer location).
Implementing a customer recommendation system based on segments.
